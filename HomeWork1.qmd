# Question 1

- Estimate prediction models of BuildYear using

    - 8/10 of "Example.csv" (training data)
    
    - OLS, RandomForest, Tree with pruning, and SimpleMean algorithm
    
    - Cross-validation to select the best algorithm
    
- Evaluate it performance using the remainings (2/8) of "Example.csv" (test data)

# Qeustion 2

- In generally,

- Why can not a good prediction model perfectly fit the training data?

- Why can we not use training data to evaluate the prediction model?

- Why can we not use test data to select the best prediction algorithm?
